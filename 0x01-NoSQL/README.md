# NoSQL Database

## Types of NoSQL Databases

1. Key-Value data stores - stored values can be any type of binary object (JSON, text, etc) and can be accessed by a key. Most flexible NoSQL model because application has control over what is stored
2. Document stores - stores self describing JSON, XML and BSON documents. Similar to key-value but differ in that a value is a single document, that stores all data related to a specific key. Document can be index for fast retrieval without knowledge of key 
3. Wide-column stores - similar to RDBMS in that they contain table and rows, but differ in names and formats of columns from row to row. It groups columns of related data togethe
4. Graph stores - graph structure to store, map and query relationships. Support index-free adjancency

Note: Multi-modal databases leverage the combination of the four types therefore supporting wider range of applications

## Benefits

1. Scalability
2. Performance
3. High Availability
4. Global Availability
5. Flexible Data Modeling

* Q1 What NoSQL means
NoSQL stands for Not-only-MySQL, meaning these are databases that do not rely only on relational databases (SQL) but can go beyond by to handle data models, offering flexibility and scalability for large-scale distributed data.
